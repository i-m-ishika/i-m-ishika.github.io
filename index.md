## About Me

Every person you ever interact with/meet has a different version of you in their mind. So, who am I? That's a multiple answer question.

My version of me: A girl who loves reading, dogs, chocolates and has a pretty quirky sense of humor. Read on, and you'll form your own version of me. Phew!


### Pro Tip #1

Things you *must* choose carefully:
1. Hair dye (You gotta live with it for months)
2. The kind of music you listen to (it can change your mood for good or bad)
3. The person you choose to share your story with. 

### Signs your heart has gone craa-zzzy for a person (named, say, X)

1. You get affected by little things your brain says are stupid but your heart disagrees.
2. All of a sudden, songs have meaning and remind you of X.
3. Your eyes are always searching for X.
    3.1. You start taking previously unexplored routes, roads that X might use.
4. Suddenly, you are very aware of X's presence.
5. You get louder/quieter when X is around.

*Author's Note: Love is beautiful, but GOD it is crazy!*
